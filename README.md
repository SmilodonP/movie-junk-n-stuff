## Challenges

_One of the challenges that we encoutered during the development process was incorporating new technologies that were unfamilair to us within the frameworks of knowledge that we contained. For example, we were using a technology that was new to us called Cypress which helped to easily test the end to end aspects of a web page. We knew what we wanted to test, but being unfamiliar with the tech made it more challenging to get to the elements that we wanted to see._

## Wins

_A win was being able to progress through the project with mostly async work. The extra communication that is required to make sure that process works and works well while allowing the project to continue was an additional step of difficulty that we handled well._
